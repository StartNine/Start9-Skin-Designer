### Security Issue 
Please contact **rob55rod/Splitwirez** as soon as possible with information on how to reproduce the problem. He can be found on Discord or GitHub.

### Non-security related isuse 
1. Please check if the issue has been already posted on the issues page 
3. Include the exact version of Start9 you are using 
4. Use a clear title and description 
5. Add steps on how to reproduce your issue 
6. Add the "bug" label 

## Submitting a suggestion 
The easiest way to have your suggestion implemented into Start9 quickly is for you or someone else write code and create a pull request. However, you may also suggest ideas using GitHub issues tracking, although it may take much longer for a feature to be added. See "[Writing Code](#writing-code)."
1. Include a clear title and description of what you want in Start9
2. Add concepts or mockups if needed
3. Add the "suggestion" label

## Writing Code 
Please save us time by complying to our code guidelines.

### Code style 
*In general, just respect the rules that are used in C# in other places.* 

**Do:** 
- Tab indentation (four spaces) 
- Allman-style bracketing. 
- camelCase for functions and locals 
- PascalCase for globals and types. 
- Allman-style indented for heavily nested function calls. 
- Use explicit over implicit type variables 
- Comment on all code written 

**Don't:** 
- Write hard to read code 
- Refuse to write documentation for the code you write for Start9 
- Spam pull requests if your first one was rejected, unless you've fixed the problem pointed out. 

### Comments 
Please comment on all your code, including functions, using XML docgen.

## Translating Start9

**SECTION TBD**: for now, use #start9 on the [Start9 Discord](https://discord.gg/6cpvxBS).
